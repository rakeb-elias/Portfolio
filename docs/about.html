            <h3>Hypothes.is Annotations on Khalid Warsame's "This Vast Conspiracy of Memory"</h3>
            <h4>September 5, 2025</h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/article.png" />
                <figcaption>Warsame reflects on how modern digital tools (like Google Maps Timeline) capture and record our movements and lives in ways we almost don’t fully realise. He explores the relationship between body, place and memory: how our physical selves carry histories of movement, of repeated return to places, of migrations and routines. He reflects on the way physical, emotional, and historical wounds linger in the body and in memory.
                    Here are some annotations I made on this essay:

            <figcaption>For this project, I kept track of my outfit/hair changes throughout the week. The final image is supposed to represent a head with strands of hair, each with different colors, shapes, sizes, and accessories.</figcaption>
