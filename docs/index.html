        <p> these lyrics are gonna be one giant paragraph because i'm too lazy (dynamite by bts by the way!)
            Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
            So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
            Shoes on, get up in the morn'
            Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
            King Kong, kick the drum
            Rolling on like a Rolling Stone
            Sing song when I'm walking home
            Jump up to the top, LeBron
            Ding dong, call me on my phone
            Ice tea and a game of ping pong
            This is getting heavy
            Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready
            Life is sweet as honey
            Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money
            Disco overload
            I'm into that, I'm good to go
            I'm diamond, you know I glow up
            Hey, so let's go
            Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
            So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
            Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
            So I'mma light it up like dynamite, woah
            Bring a friend, join the crowd
            Whoever wanna come along
            Word up, talk the talk
            Just move like we off the wall
            Day or night the sky's alight
            So we dance to the break of dawn
            Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine
            So you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh
            This is getting heavy
            Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready
            Life is sweet as honey
            Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money
            Disco overload
            I'm into that, I'm good to go
            I'm diamond, you know I glow up
            Let's go
            Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
            So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
            Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
            So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah
            Dynananananananananana            
            Life is dynamite
            Dynananananananananana
            Life is dynamite
            Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
