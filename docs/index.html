            <figcaption>My name is Rakeb Elias, and I'm a freshman at Penn State Behrend majoring in chemical engineering. My hobbies include baking, badminton, biking, traveling, and hanging out with friends. I'm from Alexandria, Virginia, which is in Northern VA (about 30 mins from DC). I went to Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, which is ranked #5 in best high schools in the US (not to brag or anything! C-; ). This is my first website that I've made with HTML, and I'm excited to share it!</figcaption>
