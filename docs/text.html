                    <figcaption>The most recurrent n-gram phrase of size 3 is "we are all", with a frequency of 3. Most n-grams of this size or higher have very low frequencies, meaning he doesn't repeat a lot of phrases with higher word counts. He says "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists", to reinforce the idea that America was founded on freedom and unity despite party differences.</figcaption>

        <h3><u>Compare/Contrast</u></h3>
        <p>When comparing the inaugural speeches of Jefferson, Kennedy, and Obama, clear patterns about how each president shapes language around their historical moment arise. All three speeches share a common theme of collective/national language, reflecting the shared goal of unifying the country at the start of each presidency. But, n-gram frequencies also highlight differences in the goals of the speeches: Jefferson focuses on democratic princples ("citizens", "government", "republican", etc.), Kennedy focuses on current, global issues ("nations", "power", "world", etc.), and Obama focuses on community actions and the future of the nation ("people", "work", "today", etc.). This is consistent with the historical contexts of each president: Jefferson's was after a fierce election in which there were extreme party divisions, Kennedy's was during the Cold War, and Obama's was during wars in the Middle East and the Great Recession. The KWIC lines help reveal how each president positions these recurring words in context: some appear consistently to appeal to the idea of unity, others used in descriptions of national challenges, and others in calls for responsibility. Overall, the comparison shows that while the three speeches share a common structure built on unity and national purpose, their word patterns differ in emphasis and most frequent ideas, reflecting the political priorities and concerns of each era.</p>
