        <h2>Web Development Essay</h2>
        <p>I was never the best in the computer science field. I barely scraped by in the class in high school, and I certainly thought I was going to struggle a bit in this web development unit, since it's all about coding. Surprisingly though, I found this unit to be pretty enjoyable and useful, especially when learning to build a website using different platforms.</p>
        <p>There were a couple advantages and disadvantages I came across when using HTML to develop my website. I think the advantages HTML has over Wordpress is that you gain valuable markup language experience that could be helpful for the future (e.g. I put in on my résumé!). I also find it easier to add different types of elements to the page such as buttons, 3D models, etc., and also adjust spacings and sizes. To a new learner like myself (since I'm not the best coder in the world), it all looked a little scary at first, but as I familiarized myself with some of the commands, elements, and functions, it became a little easier to work with. Luckily, Github and oXygen pretty much always worked smoothly for me, so I didn't face many challenges when it came to modifying the layout or the contents of the website (except for the text/image spacing... I had a big issue with it at first but I was able to fix it with CSS).</p>
        <p>The main skill needed for either format is, most evidently, coding; even in Wordpress, where you can edit pages in a visual view and also a code view. It's important to understand Git and HTML commands and basic coding terminology to minimize errors and get your site to look just how you want it to. Another skill — which I would like to improve on more — that I think is necessary for web development is graphic design. In order to have a good website, you should be able to experiment with colors, fonts, sizes, text, images, buttons, etc. to make them flow nicely and work like a professionally-made site. I would like to learn how to do this better so my sites aren't just one color/font and they look more advanced.</p>
